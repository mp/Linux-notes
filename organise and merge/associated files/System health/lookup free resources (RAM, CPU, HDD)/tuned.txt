Dynamic tuning: maximum performance from 8am, energy saving from 8pm.
(tuna is another tool for creating tuna profiles to monitor memory, cpu cores, running processes and the cgroup that they belong to.)

tuned-adm active	shows active profile
tuned-adm list		shows all profiles available
tuned-adm recommend	Checks status (e.g. whether a VM) and recommends a profile
tuned-adm off		turns off tuned-adm, shows tuned-adm active as no profile active
tuned-adm profile throughput-performance	Tune for small file performance (RH442, p.192)

e.g. RH442, p.377
tuned-adm recommend	=> virtual-guest	Suggested because it is a VM
tuned-adm profile virtual-guest
tuned-adm active	=> Current active profile: virtual guest

Example profiles:
-----------------
powersave
balanced
desktop
virtual-guest		A tuned profile for VMs
virtual-host		A tuned profile for servers hosting VMs (RH442, p.368)
network-latency
latency-performance
throughput-performance
powersave		Switch off bluetooth, soundcard. The powertop application is a top shows power consupmption of the system with devices (e.g. keyboard, soundcard, bluetooth - it shows what which devices wake up the system).

powertop2tuned -m powersave powetop	Runs powertop, analyses the system and creates a suitable tuned profile based on the analysis
tuned-adm profile powetop		Apply the powetop profile. RH442 Lab, p.364. Useful for home lab power saving!
