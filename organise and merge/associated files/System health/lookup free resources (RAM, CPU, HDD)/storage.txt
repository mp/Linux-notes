Know how much storage is on the unit. CPU, memory, and storage. Are they spinning disks (72,00 or 10K or 15K disks which are faster - or SSD hybrids?)? Are they SAN connected devices? Are they SSD (MLC, TLC, SLC)? DO They support TRIM operations?

Are they RAID 1, 0 or RAID 10? Different storage and hardware cause different speeds.

What the speed of the fibre links between remote storage? Is it fast ethernet, or 10GB or 40GB ethernet? The network connection effects storage speed (RH442, Ch. 5, Hardware Profiling). The interconnect on the motherboard will become a bottleneck: is it PCI, PCIX, PCI-E (x4, x16). What are the hyptohetical hardware limits of this, and the factors above?
