Alternative to ulimit (RH442 Lab book, p.104). Allows limiting memory and CPU time per application.
Kernel partitions available resources depending on the limit configuration.

Limits CPU shares, memory usage, block device usage.

E.g. limit application A to 1/3rd of CPU. Limit application 2 to 2/3rds of application. 

systemd-cgtop
A single command runs inside systemd-run --slice example.slice 10d	(10 days)

Ability to control memory
[Service]
Slice=works.slice
MemoryAccounting=true		Like the user/group limits for the Hadoop Hive queue
MemoryLimit=1G			Like VMware virtual machines, but by application or user
BlockIO*			Block storage restriction
CPUShares=2048			CPU shares limit
LimitNOFILE=64			Limit number of open files
LimitNPROC=32			Limit number of processes
		
/etc/systemd/system/cpuload.service.d/10-service.conf	put services into a slice
systemctl daemon-reload
