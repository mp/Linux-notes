Redhat performance co-pilot. It can be used to create graphs, and can replace other memory tools completely.

service pcp [status / start / stop]

pmstat -s 5
pmcollect 
pmatop
pminfo
pmchart

e.g.
pmstat -s 5 -t 15 	monitor 5 times every 15 seconds
pmval -t 14 -s 5 mem.freemem

pminfo -dt mem.freemem		(RH442 Lab book, p.49-60), remote X11 tool to create a live graph
pmchart is a live analysis tool to track multiple graphs - useful. Runs in X11 (preference)

Consider logging in via X11 SSH to run these graphing tools, unless using grafana to monitor multiple servers.
