Defragmentation of rotational drives is still necessary to tune performance.

xfs compensates for this, but not completely. RH442 Lab workbook, p.284 lists defragmentation tools that can be run every night (and for a given length of time, e.g. 10 minutes per night) to keep the drive in a degfragmented state.

xfs:
xfs_fsr -v -t 600	Run for 10 minutes (600 seconds)

ext4:
e4defrag -v /mnt/ext4			Defragment a mountpoint
e4defrag -v /dev/sdb1			Defragment a partition
e4defrag -v /home/user/directory	Defragment a directory

See RH442 Lab Workbook exercise (RH442, p.292) for a defragmentation example.
lsblk
fdisk /dev/sdb1
filefrag /mnt/sdb1/file
xfs_db -c frag -r /dev/sdb1
