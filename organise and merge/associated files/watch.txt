Summary
-------
watch a commands output every two seconds for changes

Example scenario
----------------
Polling a directory during ingress to check directory size (upload complete).


Command
-------
watch -d du 		# polls du every 2 seconds displaying change in filesize
			# -d highlights the differences (works fine without too)

I cannot find a way to run a command upon change, other than:
creating a script that diffs two outputs;
using entr or inotifytools (recommended) [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4060212/in-linux-how-do-i-run-a-shell-script-when-a-file-or-directory-changes]
