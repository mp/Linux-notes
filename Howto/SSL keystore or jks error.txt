If the R server cannot connect to to the SSL server, or Hadoop is suddenly unable to connect because of an SSL error, it is probably because they key has expired.

ALWAYS TAKE A BACKUP!

This can cause Tableau or Rserver to not refresh (two different errors with the same fix).

Log onto server.
)
1. check the certificate'S expiry date:
keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/hive/conf/hiveserver2.jks

2. create a new certificate if it has expired:
sudo  keytool -genkeypair -alias hiveserver2 -keyalg RSA –dname “CN=...” -keystore /etc/hive/conf/hiveserver2.jks -validity 9999

sudo  keytool -export -alias hiveserver2 -keystore /etc/hive/conf/hiveserver2.jks -rfc -file /etc/hive/conf/hiveserver2.pem

In the case of the R server, it was just a case of logging on and checking the file that is specified in the error. Again, run keytool -list as before.
Note that on the R server as well:

Oner: CN=...
Issuer: CN=...

Which means that the key was just copied over from the server.
This means the key does not have to be regnerated (because it has the same header): just scp'd from from the server.
