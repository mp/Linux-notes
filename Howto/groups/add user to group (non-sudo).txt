usermod -a -G group user

ALTERNATIVE:

cp /etc/group /etc/group.backup

vigr

Also edit the shadow group file with:

vigr -s

The vipw and vigr tools create backup files in /etc called passwd-, shadow-, group- and gshadow- with the same permissions and ownership as the originals.

Tip:
Do not edit the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow.
Use vipw, vipw -s, vigr, vigr -s instead


PUPPET SPECIFIC:
Add user to puppet.


REMOVE A USER FROM A GROUP
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29570/how-do-i-remove-a-user-from-a-group

On Debian, the adduser package contains a deluser program which removes a user from a group if you pass both as arguments:

deluser user group

If your distribution doesn't have adduser, you can edit /etc/group and /etc/gshadow manually.

vigr
vigr -s
